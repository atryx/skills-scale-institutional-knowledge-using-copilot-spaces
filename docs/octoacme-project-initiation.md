## Decision Log Template
Track key decisions made during initiation to maintain accountability and context.

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Owner | Stakeholders Consulted |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|------------------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | [Decision made] | [Why this was chosen] | [Name] | [Names/Roles] |

**Example:**

## Stakeholder Review Points
Key moments where stakeholder sign-off is required:
1. **Initial Approval**: After one-pager is drafted (Product Lead + Sponsor)
2. **Requirements Sign-off**: After Business Analyst completes requirements (Key Stakeholders)
3. **Go/No-Go Decision**: Before moving to planning phase (Sponsor + Product Lead + Project Manager)
