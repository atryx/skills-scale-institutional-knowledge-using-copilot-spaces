# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This repository contains comprehensive guides and processes that enable our teams to deliver high-quality software efficiently and collaboratively.

## Summary

OctoAcme's project management processes are designed to ensure efficient delivery of high-quality software by integrating clear workflows, defined roles, strong communication practices, and robust quality assurance. The framework is centered on iterative delivery, customer-focused priorities, and a collaborative environment where clear ownership and data-informed decisions drive outcomes. The project lifecycle includes initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospectives, with each phase supported by specific artifacts, communication cadences, and defined responsibilities.

### Key Workflows

Our workflows are built around proven practices that promote transparency and efficiency:

- **GitHub Projects**: We use GitHub Projects for task management with clearly defined columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done
- **Pull Request (PR) Workflow**: Emphasizes small PRs, clear acceptance criteria, automated testing, and at least one approval before merging
- **Planning and Execution**: Structured with prioritized backlogs, Definition of Done (DoD), and release plans
- **Risk Management**: Actively managed through a Risk Register and weekly syncs
- **Retrospectives**: Regular reflection on performance with actionable changes for continuous improvement

### Core Roles

Clear ownership and accountability are fundamental to our success:

- **Product Managers (PdMs)**: Define outcomes, prioritize backlogs, and measure success
- **Project Managers (PMs)**: Coordinate delivery, manage risks, and facilitate communication
- **Developers**: Implement features and collaborate on design and testing
- **QA Professionals**: Contribute to quality assurance through comprehensive testing

### Communication Practices

Communication is a cornerstone of our process, ensuring alignment across all stakeholders:

- **Daily Standups**: Quick synchronization on progress and blockers
- **Weekly Syncs**: In-depth coordination between PMs, PdMs, and engineering leads
- **Monthly Stakeholder Updates**: High-level progress reports and strategic alignment
- **Templates**: Standardized formats for weekly status reports and incident summaries provide consistency and transparency

### Quality Assurance

Quality is deeply embedded in our workflows through multiple testing layers:

- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end smoke tests
- **Security Scanning**: Integrated into continuous integration (CI) pipelines
- **Manual Testing**: QA validation of acceptance criteria and user scenarios
- **Deployment Checklist**: Ensures all pre-release requirements are met, including rollback plans and post-deployment verifications

### Culture and Continuous Improvement

By combining these structured processes with a culture of psychological safety and iterative improvement, OctoAcme delivers products that are both high-quality and aligned with customer and business needs.
