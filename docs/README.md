# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This README serves as a central entry point for new and existing team members to understand, navigate, and apply our project management processes.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes blend clear workflows, well-defined roles, and robust communication practices. Initiatives begin with a structured project initiation guide to validate business need, align stakeholders, and establish measurable success criteria, supported by key artifacts like a Project One-pager and stakeholder lists. Core roles—Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA/Testing, and Stakeholders—are clearly defined, with responsibilities spanning coordination, vision, delivery, validation, and approvals.

Workflows focus on iterative delivery using tools such as GitHub Projects, with disciplined pull request conventions, regular standups, weekly delivery syncs, and demos at sprint milestones. Quality assurance is achieved through rigorous unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, CI-driven security scanning, and formal checklists before release. Communication is maintained via weekly and monthly updates, risk registers, and structured escalation paths.

After each milestone or incident, retrospectives capture learnings and drive continuous improvement, reinforced by actionable templates and a culture of transparency. These processes ensure teams deliver high-quality outcomes efficiently while continuously improving based on data, feedback, and lessons learned.
